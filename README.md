# Machine Learning and Its Applications
Assignment 1: 
* Perform Find-S algorithm
* Derive decision tree produced by ID3 algorithm

Assignment 2: 
* Calculate lowest accuracy of decision trees
* Calculate the error rate of KNN
* Output the classification of each test instance

Assignment 3: 
* Build a base classifier (single decision tree, ensemble classifier that combines multiple decision trees, Random Forest)
* Find combination of SVM hyperparameters that leads to the best prediction performance

Assignment 4: 
* Find combination of Perceptron hyperparameters that leads to the best prediction performance
